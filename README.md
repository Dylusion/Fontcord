# FontcordBD

A quick and easy way to configure your Discord Client's global font without editing a line of CSS or using large themes

# Why Fontcord
Some prefer keeping the original Discord UI while changing only the font. This plugin allows you to browse through fonts available on Google Fonts, and use them with your client seamlessly.
